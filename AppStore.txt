LEDsFlash, the unique dynamic flashlight app, let's you flash your iPhone in four amazing ways: beat, shake, tap, and move.  Own the show!

1. 'Beat It' - Turn your iPhone 4 in a tantalizing disco light as it picks up music from the (built-in, or headset) microphone.  Of course LEDsFlash allows iPod to play in the background on the speaker.

Because LEDsFlash quickly (within a second) adjusts to changing sound levels automatically, it works well for all volumes.

You can set sensitivity to match the music/sound type; but leaving it at a high value is already perfect for almost everything.

2. 'Shake It' - Hold firmly in your hand and see the rhythm!  Specific noise filtering inside LEDsFlash, gives you solid flashes.  You can set the sensitivity.

3. 'Tap It' - Get cool flashes by tapping screen with one or more fingers.  You can set the duration of the flash time (from approximately 1/30 to 1/3 of a second).

With duration at the far left, the light stays on as long as you touch the screen.  So yes, LEDsFlash can also be used as static flashlight.

4. 'Move It' - Gives you a motion controlled stroboscope in your hand.  The iPhone 4's gyroscope senses how you move and turn, and creates a linear stream of flashes.  You really need to experience this; it will wow you!  You can set the flash speed.

Design: Modern minimalistic, with focus on well working and easy to use features, for you.  We want your input for future release!

Advice: Go get LEDsFlash.  Steal the show!
